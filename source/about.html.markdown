Hi there, I’m Louis Marascio. I’m an entrepreneur and I have been for as long
as I can remember. I enjoy starting companies and building teams to solve
interesting and challenging problems.

I am the Founder and Managing Partner of Tariten Trading, a proprietary
automated trading firm that uses machine learning and other scientific methods
to trade the financial markets.

Previously, I was one of four co-founders of LugIron Software where I also
served as the CEO. LugIron developed a media analytics platform to help
companies measure, analyze and optimize the performance of their social media
efforts. Unfortunately, after an 18 month slog, LugIron was shutdown. Maybe
I’ll write a post about that one day.

Prior to LugIron, I was a founder and CTO of Metreos Corporation. I lead the
team responsible for designing one of the first easy-to-use integrated
development and run time environments for enterprise IP telephony
applications. After five and a half years of growing the company, Metreos was
acquired by Cisco where I went on to become the Director of Engineering
responsible for the Cisco Unified Application Environment, the development
platform for the Cisco Unified Communications System.

I live and work on the northside of Houston, Texas with my wife and three
little girls.
