**DRAFT**

Time is a tricky beast and analyzing historical events based on time is
frought with peril. One must be diligent and skeptical, especially when the
methodology for data collection is unknown or farmed out to a third party.

Most importantly the means by which a timestamp is calculated is critical.

sources of error
    timestamps calculated by the same entity?
        if not, how were disparate clocks synchronized?

    how were observations done? data push or data poll?
        if polling, from how many points of observation?
        in particular, if polling a website was caching handled properly?

when did something actually happen?

if you're making an observation, how do you prove to yourself observation is
not subject to individual bias?
